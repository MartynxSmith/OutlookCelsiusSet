# OutlookCelsiusSet
Sets C' for Outlook calendar weather location rather than F'

Designed to be used as login script via GPO.
Tested with 2013, 2019 Should work with 2016 also but haven't been able to test.

You will need to save the x2 config files in a shared directory, accesible by your users and amend the path varibles on line 10 and 11 of the PS1 file to point to these.

Then setup script to run on login in group policy.
